Hi,

my name is **Karnika Singh**.

I hold an integrated Masters of Technology degree in Biomedical Engineering from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad.
I graduated second in batch with a CGPA of 9.0/10. I am currently working as a Business Intelligence & Analytic Consultant at Thorogood Associates. I am a medical technology enthusiast and firmly believe that the answers to the global healthcare concerns lie at the intersection of various fields. 

I am excited about the potential that data analytics holds in the field of healthcare. I envision a revolution in healthcare which would equip us with the tools to face health care challenges before they become costly. By combining patient's genetic information with their behavioural and lifestyle information, we can truly usher in the era of precision medicine.

I belive healthcare is the greatest equaliser and by improved healthcare access, we can realise the dream of a disease-free world.

**RESEARCH EXPERIENCE**

Indian Institute of Information Technology-Allahabad, Graduate Research Assistant (Thesis Dissertation)

**Design and development of a novel microdevice for artificial lung application** 		       Aug/2016 – June/2017

•	Developed a multi-layered respiratory assist microfluidic construct, containing ultrathin, non-porous, gas exchange membrane, aimed at enhancing gas transfer efficiency while minimizing membrane-fluid contact area.  Also gained experience in microfluidic flow simulation using Comsol.

**ACADEMIC PROJECTS**


**Non-Invasive Infrared Vein Locator** 	                                                     Jan/2016 – May/2016 
Indian Institute of Information Technology-Allahabad, Undergraduate Research Assistant

•	Designed and developed a low-cost device that allows visualization of the subject's veins under a source of infrared radiation using the principle of the specific absorption of infrared radiation in blood vessels.


**Osmotic Pump for Colon targeted drug delivery**                                         July/2015-Dec/2015 
Indian Institute of Information Technology-Allahabad, Undergraduate Research Assistant

•	Designed a biocompatible osmotic pump for sustained and targeted drug delivery to the colon via the oral route that can be used in the treatment of colon diseases. Demonstrated sustained release from the device.


**Computer Aided Drug Design for Management of Lung Infection in Cystic Fibrosis patients**   Jan/2015 – May/2015 
Indian Institute of Information Technology-Allahabad, Undergraduate Research Assistant

•	Pseudomonas aeruginosa has rapidly developed resistance to antibiotics. We studied the signaling pathways of this pathogen to find out a suitable target for developing efficient and novel therapeutics which could potentially control its growth. I also implemented a chemical sub-structure based model to predict drug side effects for this target.					
Respiratory Sound Analysis using Matlab – Undergraduate Research Assistant, IIITA	        July/2014 – Dec/2014
•	Developed a system to acquire, process and analyze the respiratory sounds for automated diagnosis of respiratory disorders using Matlab. 
•	Demonstrated automated diagnosis of crackles and wheezes from respiratory sounds acquired from healthy individuals as well as from people suffering from various respiratory disorders.
