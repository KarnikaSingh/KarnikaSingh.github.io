Hi,

my name is **Karnika Singh**.

I hold an integrated Masters of Technology degree in Biomedical Engineering from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad.
I graduated second in batch with a CGPA of 9.0/10. I am currently working as a Business Intelligence & Analytic Consultant at Thorogood Associates. I am a medical technology enthusiast and firmly believe that the answers to the global healthcare concerns lie at the intersection of various fields. 

I am excited about the potential that data analytics holds in the field of healthcare. I envision a revolution in healthcare which would equip up with the tools to face health care challenges before they become costly. By combining patient's genetic information with their behavioural and lifestyle information, we can truly usher in the era of precision medicine.

I belive healthcare is the greatest equaliser and by improved healthcare access, we can realise the dream of a disease-free world.
